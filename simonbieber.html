Simon has represented a broad range of clients, including various professionals (including lawyers and accountants), directors and officers, and other public and private companies.</p>
	    			 
	    			<p>Simon’s practice includes regularly arbitrating and mediating commercial matters. The arbitrations typically involve the interpretation of commercial agreements, price adjustments and disputes over fair value.<p>
