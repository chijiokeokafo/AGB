					<h1 class="case-title">Cricket Canada v. Syed COMMERCIAL</h1>
					<h1 class="case-number">2017 ONSC 3301</h1>
					<p class="case-body">Adair Barristers (Jordan Goldblatt)  was counsel to Cricket Canada in a succesful application to set aside an arbitrator's award which proposed to direct members of a not for profit corporation in respect of corporate governance matters. The decision was the subject of a story in the Law Times published on August 14, 2017.</p>

				<div class="case">
					<h1 class="case-title">Tracy v. Iran</h1>
					<!-- <h1 class="case-number">2017 ONSC 3301</h1> -->
					<p class="case-body">Adair Barristers successfully represented the plaintiffs in this claim to enforce a foreign judgment against the Republic of Iran under Canada's Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act. The case is the first terrorism claim to be litigated in Canada, and our clients were successful in obtaining an Order recognizing the foreign judgment and permitting execution against assets that Iran argued enjoy diplomatic immunity. The case involved significant novel issues in the areas of state immunity and diplomatic immunity, and received substantial media attention in both Canada and Iran.</p>

				<div class="case">
					<h1 class="case-title">Onex Corp. v. American Home</h1>
					<h1 class="case-number">2014 ONSC 6918</h1>
					<p class="case-body">Adair Barristers (Geoff Adair and Khalid Janmohamed) acted for Onex Corporation and recovered judgment after trial against American Home Assurance Co. for $15 million USD in this hard fought directors and officers liability insurance case.</p>

				<div class="case">
					<h1 class="case-title">Couper v. Nu-Life</h1>
					<!-- <h1 class="case-number">2017 ONSC 3301</h1> -->
					<p class="case-body">Adair Barristers acted for the plaintiff in this breach of contract claim. After a four-week trial, the plaintiff's action was allowed, with the plaintiff being awarded damages and costs in excess of $1,600,000. The case is significant because the plaintiff had to prove the existence of a contract despite not having any signed document, and Adair Barristers succeeded in establishing that there was a meeting of the minds on all material terms. The defendants also moved for a mistrial on the basis of an alleged reasonable apprehension of bias, and Adair Barristers successfully defeated that motion.</p>
