	    			<h1>Geoff Adair<!-- , <span class="position">Partner</span> --></h1>

	    			<p>Geoff Adair is a founding partner of Adair Goldblatt Bieber LLP.</p>
	    			 
	    			<p>Geoff is one of Canada’s leading trial and appellate lawyers. He has tried to verdict or argued on appeal as many or more judge alone or judge and jury cases than any other lawyer in the Province of Ontario. His considerable depth of courtroom experience includes acting as lead counsel in lawsuits ranging from the most sophisticated commercial litigation matters to major tort cases, contentious insurance claims, income tax appeals, and even murder trials.<p>
	    			 
	    			<p>Geoff’s practice now focuses on commercial litigation, professional liability and product liability claims whether for plaintiffs or defendants, substantial insurance coverage disputes including directors’ and officers’ liability insurance cases for insurers and insureds, and serious tort litigation including defamation actions, bad faith, wrongful death and significant personal injury matters.</p>

	    			<p>Geoff is the author of On Trial, Advocacy Skills Law and Practice, a leading text on advocacy described by Justice Renaud as “a treasure trove for litigators”. The book has been cited by courts across Canada on various points of advocacy.</p>

	    			<p>Geoff is a past president of the Canadian Bar Association – Ontario Branch Civil Litigation Section, and served for many years as an instructor in the Law Society of Upper Canada Bar Admission Course – Civil Litigation Section. He is a regular and frequent lecturer at continuing education programs, including the Law Society of Upper Canada Special Lecture series as well as programs and trial demonstrations promoted by the Ontario Trial Lawyers Association, the Advocates Society, and the Canadian Bar Association – Ontario Branch.</p>
